what are factors in identity transformation? 
  (Barth)
•	“If a group maintains its identity when members interact with others, this entails criteria for determining membership and ways of signalling membership and exclusion” pg 15
•	When you join the group, your identity shifts/changes. Therefore, you aren’t bound to any place. When you go around, you encode the info who is in the group and who is not in the group. Necessitates a decision, how to initiate or exclude people from the group, which is where culture develops from. Allows for the existence of polyethnic groups
